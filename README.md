# BrowserGym White Agent for AgentBeats Evaluation

This repository contains our team’s **BrowserGym White Agent**, designed to execute web-based tasks on the **AgentBeats** platform. The agent supports three official BrowserGym benchmarks: **MiniWoB++**, **WebLINX**, and **AssistantBench**.

All benchmarks are orchestrated and evaluated by corresponding **Green Agents** (see our Green Agent submission). This repository focuses specifically on the **scenario implementations** used by the White Agent for each benchmark.

The White Agent is optimized for **MiniWoB++**, **WebLINX**, and **AssistantBench** tasks, while remaining sufficiently general to perform beyond the provided sample evaluation tasks. Task execution and performance are assessed by the Green Agents.
